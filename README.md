# gnomp - GNOME Backup & Restore Script

A simple script to backup and restore GNOME settings, extensions, and their configurations. Supports both Wayland and X11 sessions.

## Features

* **Comprehensive Backup:** Backs up GNOME settings (`dconf`), user extensions, and key config directories.
* **Easy Restore:** Restores all settings and extensions from a single timestamped backup file.
* **Auto-Reload:** Fully reloads the GNOME Shell and extensions after a restore to apply settings immediately.
* **Drag-and-Drop:** Supports dragging and dropping the backup file onto the terminal when prompted for the path.
* **Safe Backups:** Creates timestamped backups to prevent new backups from overwriting old ones.

2.  Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x gnomp.sh
    ```

---

## Usage

1.  Run the script in your terminal:
    ```bash
    ./gnomp.sh
    ```
2.  Choose an option from the menu:
    * **1: Backup** - Creates a new backup of your current settings.

## Backup Details

### Backup Location

All backups are saved as `.tar.gz` files in:
`$HOME/gnome_backup`

### What's Included

Each backup archive contains:

* A full `dconf` export of all GNOME settings.
* `~/.config`
* `~/.local/share`
* `~/.gnome`
* `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`

---

## Notes

* **On Wayland:** Extensions are reloaded automatically using D-Bus. However, some complex extensions may still require a manual logout and login to fully apply all changes.
* **On X11:** The script will automatically restart the GNOME Shell to apply the restored settings.
